# My portfolio

## What this is
This repo contains the source code for Gatsby to generate and deploy [my website to Github](https://filipeeestacio.github.io).

## Motivation
I wanted to not only build a portfolio for my web development activities but also to document the learning (both the successes and difficulties) as I go along. I've committed myself to doing the best I can to maintain some log of my thoughts and development.
